Arduino
=======

Built Simon game with Arduino for fun and knowledge. Arduino uses C language to program; which was used to program everything. There is 
LEDs, buzzer, push buttons, and LCD involved to construct everything. I made the game so the player gets 3 tries before game over (star wars melody 
plays). After completing 15 levels (quickly reached) the player wins and a melody from Zelda will play.
